ClaRe Dashboard aims to provide toolkits to explore datasets in a visualized way, especially for multivariate time-series with mixed sampling rates. The dashboard was build with R Shiny package and it provides an experimental pipeline for time series data analysis with straightforward steps such as:
- Data uploading, 
- Pre-processing (merge, manage missing values, plot etc.), 
- Modeling (regression, classification), and 
- Evaluation (model summary, visualization, export-import model).

Its friendly and interactive environment can be easily used from both experts and non-experts.
